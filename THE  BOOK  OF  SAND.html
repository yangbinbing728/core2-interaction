      <div id="sourceText" style="display:none; white-space:pre-wrap;">
one  had  sat  down  at  the  other  end  of  the  bench.  I would  have  preferred  to  be  alone,  but  not  wishing to  appear  unsociable  I  avoided  getting  up abruptly.  The  other  man  had  begun  to  whistle.  It was  then  that  the  first  of  the  many  disquieting things  of  that  morning  occurred.  What  he  whistled, what  he  tried  to  whistle  (I  have  no  ear  for music),  was  the  tune  of  "La  tapera,"  an  old milonga  by  Elias  Regules.  The  melody  took  me back  to  a  certain  Buenos  Aires  patio,  which  has long  since  disappeared,  and  to  the  memory  of  my cousin  Alvaro  Melian  Lafinur,  who  has  been  dead for  so  many  years.  Then  came  the  words.  They were  those  of  the  opening  line.  It  was  not  Alvaro's voice  but  an  imitation  of  it.  Recognizing  this,  I  was taken  aback. 
"Sir,"  I  said,  turning  to  the  other  man,  "are  you an  Uruguayan  or  an  Argentine?" 
"Argentine,  but  I've  lived  in  Geneva  since 1914,"  he  replied. 
There  was  a  long  silence.  "At  number  seventeen Malagnou — across  from  the  Orthodox  church?"  I asked. 
He  answered  in  the  affirmative. 
"In  that  case,"  I  said  straight  out,  "your  name  is Jorge  Luis  Borges.  I,  too,  am  Jorge  Luis  Borges. This  is  1969  and  we're  in  the  city  of  Cambridge." 
"No,"  he  said  in  a  voice  that  was  mine  but  a  bit removed.  He  paused,  then  became  insistent.  "I'm here  in  Geneva,  on  a  bench,  a  few  steps  from  the Rhone.  The  strange  thing  is  that  we  resemble  each other,  but  you're  much  older  and  your  hair  is gray." 
"I  can  prove  I'm  not  lying,"  I  said.  "I'm  going  to tell  you  things  a  stranger  couldn't  possibly  know. 
At  home  we  have  a  silver  mate  cup  with  a  base  in the  form  of  entwined  serpents.  Our  great-grandfather brought  it  from  Peru.  There's  also  a  silver washbasin  that  hung  from  his  saddle.  In  the  wardrobe of  your  room  are  two  rows  of  books:  the three  volumes  of  Lane's  Thousand  and  One Nights,  with  steel  engravings  and  with  notes  in small  type  at  the  end  of  each  chapter;  Quicherat's Latin  dictionary;  Tacitus'  Germania  in  Latin  and also  in  Gordon's  English  translation;  a  Don  Quixote published  by  Gamier;  Rivera  Indarte's  Tabids  de Sangre,  inscribed  by  the  author;  Carlyle's  Sartor Resartus;  a  biography  of  Amiel;  and,  hidden  behind the  other  volumes,  a  book  in  paper  covers about  sexual  customs  in  the  Balkans.  Nor  have  I forgotten  one  evening  on  a  certain  second  floor  of the  Place  Dubourg." 
"Dufour,"  he  corrected. 
"Very  well — Dufour.  Is  this  enough  now?" 
"No,"  he  said.  "These  proofs  prove  nothing.  If  I am  dreaming  you,  it's  natural  that  you  know  what I  know.  Your  catalog,  for  all  its  length,  is  completely worthless." 
His  objection  was  to  the  point.  I  said,  "If  this morning  and  this  meeting  are  dreams,  each  of  us has  to  believe  that  he  is  the  dreamer.  Perhaps  we have  stopped  dreaming,  perhaps  not.  Our  obvious duty,  meanwhile,  is  to  accept  the  dream  just  as  we accept  the  world  and  being  born  and  seeing  and breathing." 
"And  if  the  dream  should  go  on?"  he  said  anxiously. 
To  calm  him  and  to  calm  myself,  I  feigned  an air  of  assurance  that  I  certainly  did  not  feel.  "My dream  has  lasted  seventy  years  now,"  I  said.  "After all,  there  isn't  a  person  alive  who,  on  waking,  does not  find  himself  with  himself.  It's  what  is  happening to  us  now — except  that  we  are  two.  Don't  you want  to  know  something  of  my  past,  which  is  the future  awaiting  you?" 
He  assented  without  a  word.  I  went  on,  a  bit lost.  "Mother  is  healthy  and  well  in  her  house  on Charcas  and  Maipti,  in  Buenos  Aires,  but  Father died  some  thirty  years  ago.  He  died  of  heart trouble.  Hemiplegia  finished  him;  his  left  hand, placed  on  his  right,  was  like  the  hand  of  a  child  on a  giant's.  He  died  impatient  for  death  but  without complaint.  Our  grandmother  had  died  in  the  same house.  A  few  days  before  the  end,  she  called  us  all together  and  said,  'I'm  an  old  woman  who  is  dying very,  very  slowly.  Don't  anyone  become  upset about  such  a  common,  everyday  thing.'  Your  sister, Norah,  married  and  has  two  sons.  By  the  way, how  is  everyone  at  home?" 
"Quite  well.  Father  makes  his  same  antireligious jokes.  Last  night  he  said  that  Jesus  was  like  the gauchos,  who  don't  like  to  commit  themselves,  and that's  why  he  preached  in  parables."  He  hesitated and  then  said,  "And  you?" 
"I  don't  know  the  number  of  books  you'll  write, but  I  know  they'll  be  too  many.  You'll  write  poems that  will  give  you  a  pleasure  that  others  won't  share and  stories  of  a  somewhat  fantastic  nature.  Like your  father  and  so  many  others  of  our  family,  you will  teach." 
It  pleased  me  that  he  did  not  ask  about  the  success or  failure  of  his  books.  I  changed  my  tone  and went  on.  "As  for  history,  there  was  another  war, almost  among  the  same  antagonists.  France  was not    long    in    caving    in;    England    and    America fought  against  a  German  dictator  named  Hitler — the  cyclical  battle  of  Waterloo.  Around  1946, Buenos  Aires  gave  birth  to  another  Rosas,  who bore  a  fair  resemblance  to  our  kinsman.  In  1955, the  province  of  Cordoba  came  to  our  rescue,  as Entre  Rios  had  in  the  last  century.  Now  things  are going  badly.  Russia  is  taking  over  the  world; America,  hampered  by  the  superstition  of  democracy, can't  make  up  its  mind  to  become  an  empire. With  every  day  that  passes,  our  country  becomes more  provincial.  More  provincial  and  more  pretentious— as  if  its  eyes  were  closed.  It  wouldn't  surprise me  if  the  teaching  of  Latin  in  our  schools were  replaced  by  that  of  Guarani." 
I  could  tell  that  he  was  barely  paying  attention. The  elemental  fear  of  what  is  impossible  and  yet what  is  so  dismayed  him.  I,  who  have  never  been  a father,  felt  for  that  poor  boy — more  intimate  to me  even  than  a  son  of  my  flesh — a  surge  of  love. Seeing  that  he  clutched  a  book  in  his  hands,  I asked  what  it  was. 
"The  Possessed,  or,  as  I  believe,  The  Devils,  by Fedor  Dostoevski,"  he  answered,  not  without  vanity. 
"It  has  faded  in  my  memory.  What's  it  like?"  As soon  as  I  said  this,  I  felt  that  the  question  was  a blasphemy. 
"The  Russian  master,"  he  pronounced,  "has seen  better  than  anyone  else  into  the  labyrinth  of the  Slavic  soul." 
This  attempt  at  rhetoric  seemed  to  me  proof that  he  had  regained  his  composure.  I  asked  what other  volumes  of  the  master  he  had  read.  He  mentioned two  or  three,  among  them  The  Doable.  I then    asked    him    if  on    reading   them    he    could clearly  distinguish  the  characters,  as  you  could  in Joseph  Conrad,  and  if  he  thought  of  going  on  in his  study  of  Dostoevski's  work. 
"Not  really,"  he  said  with  a  certain  surprise. 
I  asked  what  he  was  writing  and  he  told  me  he was  putting  together  a  book  of  poems  that  would be  called  Red  Hymns.  He  said  he  had  also  considered calling  it  Red  Rhythms. 
"And  why  not?"  I  said.  "You  can  cite  good  antecedents. Ruben  Dario's  blue  verse  and  Verlaine's gray  song." 
Ignoring  this,  he  explained  that  his  book  would celebrate  the  brotherhood  of  man.  The  poet  of our  time  could  not  turn  his  back  on  his  own  age, he  went  on  to  say.  I  thought  for  a  while  and  asked if  he  truly  felt  himself  a  brother  to  everyone — to all  funeral  directors,  for  example,  to  all  postmen, to  all  deep-sea  divers,  to  all  those  who  lived  on  the even-numbered  side  of  the  street,  to  all  those  who were  aphonic,  and  so  on.  He  answered  that  his book  referred  to  the  great  mass  of  the  oppressed and  alienated. 
"Your  mass  of  oppressed  and  alienated  is  no more  than  an  abstraction,"  I  said.  "Only  individuals exist — if  it  can  be  said  that  anyone  exists.  'The man  of  yesterday  is  not  the  man  of  today,'  some Greek  remarked.  We  two,  seated  on  this  bench  in Geneva  or  Cambridge,  are  perhaps  proof  of  this." 
Except  in  the  strict  pages  of  history,  memorable events  stand  in  no  need  of  memorable  phrases.  At the  point  of  death,  a  man  tries  to  recall  an  engraving glimpsed  in  childhood;  about  to  enter  battle, soldiers  speak  of  the  mud  or  of  their  sergeant. Our  situation  was  unique  and,  frankly,  we  were unprepared  for  it.  As  fate  would  have  it,  we  talked about  literature;  I  fear  I  said  no  more  than  the things  I  usually  say  to  journalists.  My  alter  ego believed  in  the  invention,  or  discovery,  of  new metaphors;  I,  in  those  metaphors  that  correspond to  intimate  and  obvious  affinities  and  that  our imagination  has  already  accepted.  Old  age  and sunset,  dreams  and  life,  the  flow  of  time  and water.  I  put  forward  this  opinion,  which  years later  he  would  put  forward  in  a  book.  He  barely listened  to  me.  Suddenly,  he  said,  "If  you  have been  me,  how  do  you  explain  the  fact  that  you have  forgotten  your  meeting  with  an  elderly  gentleman who  in  1918  told  you  that  he,  too,  was Borges?" 
I  had  not  considered  this  difficulty.  "Maybe  the event  was  so  strange  I  chose  to  forget  it,"  I  answered without  much  conviction. 
Venturing  a  question,  he  said  shyly,  "What's your  memory  like?" 
I  realized  that  to  a  boy  not  yet  twenty  a  man  of over  seventy  was  almost  in  the  grave.  "It  often approaches  forgetfulness,"  I  said,  "but  it  still  finds what  it's  asked  to  find.  I  study  Old  English,  and  I am  not  at  the  bottom  of  the  class." 
Our  conversation  had  already  lasted  too  long  to be  that  of  a  dream.  A  sudden  idea  came  to  me.  "I can  prove  at  once  that  you  are  not  dreaming  me," I  said.  "Listen  carefully  to  this  line,  which,  as  far  as I  know,  you've  never  read." 
Slowly  I  entoned  the  famous  verse,  "L'hydreunivers  tordant  son  corps  ecaille  d'astres."  I  felt  his  almost fearful  awe.  He  repeated  the  line,  lowvoiced,  savoring  each  resplendent  word. 
"It's  true,"  he  faltered.  "I'll  never  be  able  to write  a  line  like  that." 
Victor  Hugo  had  brought  us  together. 
Before  this,  I  now  recall,  he  had  fervently  recited that  short  piece  of  Whitman's  in  which  the poet  remembers  a  night  shared  beside  the  sea when  he  was  really  happy. 
"If  Whitman  celebrated  that  night,"  I  remarked, "it's  because  he  desired  it  and  it  did  not  happen. The  poem  gains  if  we  look  on  it  as  the  expression of  a  longing,  not  the  account  of  an  actual  happening." 
He  stared  at  me  open-mouthed.  "You  don't know  him!"  he  exclaimed.  "Whitman  is  incapable of  telling  a  lie." 
Half  a  century  does  not  pass  in  vain.  Beneath our  conversation  about  people  and  random  reading and  our  different  tastes,  I  realized  that  we were  unable  to  understand  each  other.  We  were too  similar  and  too  unalike.  We  were  unable  to take  each  other  in,  which  makes  conversation  difficult. Each  of  us  was  a  caricature  copy  of  the other.  The  situation  was  too  abnormal  to  last much  longer.  Either  to  offer  advice  or  to  argue was  pointless,  since,  unavoidably,  it  was  his  fate  to become  the  person  I  am. 
All  at  once,  I  remembered  one  of  Coleridge's fantasies.  Somebody  dreams  that  on  a  journey through  paradise  he  is  given  a  flower.  On  awaking, he  finds  the  flower.  A  similar  trick  occurred  to me.  "Listen,"  I  said.  "Have  you  any  money?" 
"Yes,"  he  replied.  "I  have  about  twenty  francs. I've  invited  Simon  Jichlinski  to  dinner  at  the  Crocodile tonight." 
"Tell  Simon  that  he  will  practice  medicine  in Carouge  and  that  he  will  do  much  good.  Now, give  me  one  of  your  coins." 
He  drew  out  three  large  silver  pieces  and  some small  change.  Without  understanding,  he  offered me  a  five-franc  coin.  I  handed  him  one  of  those not  very  sensible  American  bills  that,  regardless  of their  value,  are  all  the  same  size.  He  examined  it avidly. 
"It  can't  be,"  he  said,  his  voice  raised.  "It  bears the  date  1964.  All  this  is  a  miracle,  and  the  miraculous is  terrifying.  Witnesses  to  the  resurrection  of Lazarus  must  have  been  horrified." 
We  have  not  changed  in  the  least,  I  thought  to myself.  Ever  the  bookish  reference.  He  tore  up  the bill  and  put  his  coins  away.  I  decided  to  throw mine  into  the  river.  The  arc  of  the  big  silver  disk losing  itself  in  the  silver  river  would  have  conferred on  my  story  a  vivid  image,  but  luck  would not  have  it  so.  I  told  him  that  the  supernatural,  if it  occurs  twice,  ceases  to  be  terrifying.  I  suggested that  we  plan  to  see  each  other  the  next  day,  on  this same  bench,  which  existed  in  two  times  and  in  two places.  He  agreed  at  once  and,  without  looking  at his  watch,  said  that  he  was  late.  Both  of  us  were lying  and  we  each  knew  it  of  the  other.  I  told  him that  someone  was  coming  for  me. 
"Coming  for  you?"  he  said. 
"Yes.  When  you  get  to  my  age,  you  will  have  lost your  eyesight  almost  completely.  You'll  still  make out  the  color  yellow  and  lights  and  shadows.  Don't worry.  Gradual  blindness  is  not  a  tragedy.  It's  like a  slow  summer  dusk." 
We  said  goodbye  without  having  once  touched each  other.  The  next  day,  I  did  not  show  up.  Neither would  he. 
I  have  brooded  a  great  deal  over  that  meeting, which  until  now  I  have  related  to  no  one.  I  believe I  have  discovered  the  key.  The  meeting  was  real, but  the  other  man  was  dreaming  when  he  conversed with  me,  and  this  explains  how  he  was  able to  forget  me;  I  conversed  with  him  while  awake, and  the  memory  of  it  still  disturbs  me. 
The  other  man  dreamed  me,  but  he  did  not dream  me  exactly.  He  dreamed,  I  now  realize,  the date  on  the  dollar  bill. 
He  took  the  sword  Gram  and  laid  it  naked  between them. 
The  Saga  of  the  Volsungs,  29 
My  story  will  be  true  to  reality  or,  in  any  case,  to my  personal  memory  of  reality,  which  amounts  to the  same  thing.  The  events  took  place  only  a  short time  ago,  but  I  know  that  literary  habit  is  also  the habit  of  adding  circumstantial  details  and  of  underlining high  points.  I  want  to  give  an  account  of my  meeting  with  Ulrike  (I  never  knew7  her  surname and  perhaps  never  shall)  in  the  city  of  York. The  narrative  will  encompass  one  night  and  a morning. 
It  would  be  easy  to  say  that  I  saw  her  for  the first  time  by  the  Five  Sisters  of  York  Minster,  those stained-glass  windows  which,  pure  of  any  image, Cromwell's  iconoclasts  respected,  but  the  fact  is that  we  met  in  the  small  lounge  of  The  Northern Inn,  which  lies  outside  the  city  walls.  We  were  a handful,  and  Ulrike  stood  with  her  back  to  us. Someone  offered  her  a  drink  and  she  refused  it. 
"I  am  a  feminist,"  she  said.  "I  am  not  out  to  ape men.  I  dislike  their  tobacco  and  their  alcohol." 
The  remark  was  meant  to  be  witty,  and  I guessed  that  this  was  not  the  first  time  she  had  delivered  it.  I  later  found  out  that  it  was  not  typical of  her,  but  what  we  say  is  not  always  like  us.  She mentioned  that  she  had  arrived  at  the  museum  too late,  but  that  they  let  her  in  when  they  learned  she was  a  Norwegian. 
One  of  those  present  remarked,  "It's  not  the first  time  the  Norwegians  have  entered  York." 
"That's  right,"  she  said.  "England  was  once  ours and  we  lost  it — if  one  can  have  anything  or  if  anything can  be  lost." 
It  was  at  this  point  that  I  looked  at  her.  A  line  in Blake  speaks  of  girls  of  mild  silver  or  of  furious gold,  but  in  Ulrike  were  both  gold  and  mildness. She  was  tall  and  slender,  with  sharp  features  and gray  eyes.  Less  than  by  her  face,  I  was  impressed by  her  air  of  calm  mystery.  She  smiled  easily,  and the  smile  seemed  to  withdraw  her  from  the  company. She  was  dressed  in  black,  which  is  strange for  northern  lands,  which  try  to  liven  the  drab  surroundings with  vivid  colors.  She  spoke  a  crisp, precise  English,  rolling  her  r's  slightly.  I  am  not much  of  an  observer;  these  things  I  discovered  bit by  bit. 
We  were  introduced.  I  told  her  that  I  was  a professor  at  the  University  of  the  Andes,  in Bogota.  I  explained  that  I  was  a  Colombian. 
She  asked  me  in  a  thoughtful  way,  "What  does  it mean  to  be  a  Colombian?" 
"I  don't  know,"  I  replied.  "It's  an  act  of  faith." 
"Like  being  Norwegian,"  she  affirmed. 
I  can  remember  no  more  of  what  was  said  that night.  The  next  day,  I  came  down  to  the  dining room  early.  Through  the  windows  I  saw  that  it had  snowed;  in  the  early  morning  light  the  moors faded  away.  We  were  the  only  ones  there.  Ulrike invited  me  to  her  table.  She  told  me  that  she  liked going  out  for  solitary  walks. 
Recalling  a  joke  of  Schopenhauer's,  I  said,  "So do  I.  The  two  of  us  could  go  out  together." 
We  walked  away  from  the  inn  on  the  new-fallen snow.  There  was  not  a  soul  about.  I  suggested  that we  go  on  to  Thorgate,  a  few  miles  down  the  river. I  know  that  I  was  already  in  love  with  Ulrike;  I could  never  have  wanted  any  other  person  by  my side. 
All  at  once,  I  heard  the  distant  howling  of  a wolf.  I  had  never  before  heard  a  wolf  howl,  but  I knew  it  was  a  wolf.  Ulrike  was  impassive. 
A  while  later  she  said,  as  if  thinking  aloud,  "The few  poor  swords  I  saw  yesterday  in  York  Minster moved  me  more  than  the  great  ships  in  the  Oslo museum." 
Our  paths  had  crossed.  That  evening  Ulrike would  continue  her  journey  on  to  London;  I  to Edinburgh. 
"In  Oxford  Street,"  she  told  me,  "I  shall  follow De  Quincey's  footsteps  in  search  of  his  Ann,  lost amid  the  crowds  of  London." 
"De  Quincey  stopped  looking  for  her,"  I  replied. "All  my  life,  I  never  have." 
"Maybe  you've  found  her,"  Ulrike  said,  her voice  low. 
I  realized  that  an  unexpected  thing  was  not  forbidden me,  and  I  kissed  her  on  the  mouth  and eyes.  She  drew  away  firmly  but  gently  and  then declared,  "I'll  be  yours  in  the  inn  at  Thorgate. Until  then,  I  ask  you  not  to  touch  me.  It  is  better that  way." 
To  a  bachelor  well  along  in  years,  the  offer  of love  is  a  gift  no  longer  expected.  The  miracle  has  a right  to  impose  conditions.  I  thought  back  on  my youth  in  Popayan  and  on  a  girl  in  Texas,  as  fair and  slender  as  Ulrike,  who  once  denied  me  her love. 
I  did  not  make  the  mistake  of  asking  Ulrike whether  she  loved  me.  I  realized  that  this  was  not her  first  time  nor  would  it  be  her  last.  The  adventure, perhaps  my  last,  would  be  one  of  many  for that  splendid,  determined  follower  of  Ibsen.  Hand in  hand,  we  walked  on. 
"All  this  is  like  a  dream,  and  I  never  dream,"  I said. 
"Like  that  king  who  never  dreamed  until  a  wizard made  him  sleep  in  a  pigsty,"  Ulrike  replied. Then  she  added,  "Listen.  A  bird  is  about  to  sing." 
A  moment  or  two  later  we  heard  the  song. 
"In  these  lands,"  I  said,  "it's  thought  that  a  person about  to  die  sees  into  the  future." 
"And  I  am  about  to  die,"  she  said. 
I  looked  at  her  in  astonishment.  "Let's  cut through  the  woods,"  I  urged.  "We'll  reach Thorgate  sooner." 
"The  woods  are  dangerous,"  she  said. 
We  continued  along  the  moors. 
"I  should  like  this  moment  to  last  forever,"  I murmured. 
"  'Forever'  is  a  word  forbidden  to  men,"  Ulrike said  and,  to  soften  the  force  of  this,  she  asked  me to  repeat  my  name,  which  she  had  not  caught. 
"Javier  Otalora,"  I  said. 
She  tried  to  pronounce  it  and  couldn't.  I  failed, equally,  with  the  name  Ulrike. 
"I  shall  call  you  Sigurd,"  she  said  with  a  smile. 
"If  I  am  Sigurd,"  I  replied,  "you  will  be  Brynhild." 
She  had  slowed  her  step. 
"Do  you  know  the  saga?"  I  asked. 
"Of  course,"  she  said.  "The  tragic  story  spoiled by  the  Germans  with  their  late  Nibelungs." 
Not  wishing  to  argue  the  point,  I  answered, "Brynhild,  you're  walking  as  if  you  wished  a  sword lay  between  us  in  bed." 
Suddenly  we  stood  before  the  inn.  It  did  not surprise  me  that,  like  the  other  one,  it  was  called The  Northern  Inn. 
From  the  top  of  the  stairs,  Ulrike  called  down  to me,  "Did  you  hear  the  wolf?  There  are  no  longer any  wolves  in  England.  Hurry." 
Climbing  to  the  upper  floor,  I  noticed  that  the walls  were  papered  in  the  style  of  William  Morris, in  a  deep  red,  with  a  design  of  fruit  and  birds  intertwined. Ulrike  went  on  ahead.  The  dark  room was  low,  with  a  slanted  ceiling.  The  awaited  bed was  duplicated  in  a  dim  mirror,  and  the  polished mahogany  reminded  me  of  the  looking  glass  of Scriptures.  Ulrike  had  already  undressed.  She called  me  by  my  real  name — Javier.  I  felt  that  the snow  was  falling  faster.  Now  there  were  no  longer any  mirrors  or  furniture.  There  was  no  sword  between us.  Time  passed  like  the  sands.  In  the  darkness, centuries  old,  love  flowed,  and  for  the  first and  last  time  I  possessed  Ulrike's  image. The  Congress

Vous  y  etiez  avant  que  d'y  entrer,    et   vous   y   serez   encore   quand   vous   en   sortirez." — Diderot,  Jacques  le  Fataliste  et  son  Maitre Buenos  Aires,  1955 
Alejandro  Ferri  is  my  name.  Martial  echoes  may be  heard  in  it,  but  neither  the  metals  of  glory  nor the  great  shadow  of  the  Macedonian — the  words belong  to  the  poet  of  The  Marble  Pillars,  who  honored me  with  his  friendship — has  any  kinship  with the  nearly  anonymous  man  who  strings  together these  lines  on  the  upper  floor  of  a  hotel  on  Santiago del  Estero  Street,  on  the  south  side  of  town, which  is  no  longer  the  old  Southside.  Any  day now,  I'll  turn  seventy-one  or  seventy-two;  I  am  still teaching  English  to  a  handful  of  students.  Out  of indecision  or  carelessness,  or  for  some  other  reason, I  never  married,  and  now  I  live  alone.  Loneliness does  not  worry  me;  life  is  difficult  enough, putting  up  with  yourself  and  with  your  own  habits. I  realize  I  am  getting  on  in  years.  An  unmistakable symptom  of  this  is  the  fact  that  novelties — maybe because  I  feel  they  hold  nothing  essentially  new and  are  really  no  more  than  timid  variations— neither  interest  nor  distract  me.  When  I was  a  young  man,  I  was  fond  of  sunsets,  the  city's sprawling    slums,    and    of    unhappiness;    now    I prefer  mornings  and  downtown  and  peace.  I  no longer  play  at  being  Hamlet.  I  have  become  a member  of  the  Conservative  Party  and  of  a  chess club,  which  I  usually  attend  as  an  onlooker — sometimes an  absentminded  onlooker.  Anyone  who  is curious  may  dig  up  from  some  out-of-the-way nook  of  the  National  Library,  on  Mexico  Street,  a copy  of  my  Short  Study  of  John  Wilkins  Analytical Language,  a  work  that  sadly  stands  in  need  of  a new  edition,  if  only  to  correct  or  to  lessen  its  many mistakes.  The  library's  new  director,  I  am  told,  is  a literary  man  who  dedicates  himself  to  the  study  of ancient  languages  (as  if  modern  ones  were  not  sufficiently rudimentary)  and  to  the  demogogic  exaltation of  an  imaginary  Buenos  Aires  of  knife  fighters. I  have  never  cared  to  meet  him.  I  came  to  this city  in  1899,  an<^  only  once  did  chance  bring  me face  to  face  with  a  knife  fighter  or  with  an  individual who  had  a  reputation  as  such.  Further  on, should  the  occasion  present  itself,  I  shall  relate  the episode. 
I  have  already  said  that  I  live  alone.  Several  days ago,  a  fellow-roomer,  who  had  heard  me  speak  of Fermin  Eguren,  told  me  that  he  had  died  in  Punta del  Este. 
The  death  of  this  man,  who  was  certainly  never a  friend  of  mine,  has  unaccountably  saddened  me. I  know  that  I  am  alone;  I  know  that  in  the  whole world  I  am  the  only  keeper  of  that  secret  eventthe  Congress — whose  memory  I  can  no  longer share.  I  am  now  the  last  member  of  that  Congress. It  is  undeniable  that  all  men  are  members  of  that Congress — that  there  is  not  a  single  being  on  earth who  is  not — but  I  know  I  am  a  member  in  a  very different  way.  I  know  that  I  am,  and  that's  what sets  me  apart  from  my  numberless  colleagues, present  and  future.  It  is  undeniable  that  on  the seventh  of  February,  1904,  we  swore  by  what  is most  holy  (is  there  anything  holy  on  earth,  or  anything that  is  not?)  never  to  reveal  the  history  of  the Congress,  but  it  is  no  less  undeniable  that  my  now committing  perjury  is  also  part  of  the  Congress. This  last  statement  is  sufficiently  dim,  but  it  may whet  the  curiosity  of  my  eventual  readers. 
At  any  rate,  the  task  I  have  taken  upon  myself  is not  an  easy  one.  I  have  never  before  attempted the  art  of  narration — not  even  in  its  epistolary form — and,  what  is  doubtless  even  more  important, the  story  itself  is  unbelievable.  The  pen  of Jose  Fernandez  Irala,  the  undeservedly  forgotten author  of  The  Marble  Pillars,  was  the  one  destined for  this  work,  but  now  it  is  too  late.  I  shall  not  deliberately falsify  the  real  facts,  although  I  foresee that  laziness  and  incompetence  will  more  than once  lead  me  into  error.   
Exact  dates  are  of  no  account.  Let  it  be  recalled that  I  came  from  Santa  Fe,  my  native  province,  in 1899.  I  have  never  gone  back.  I  have  grown  accustomed to  Buenos  Aires,  a  city  I  am  not  fond  of,  in the  same  way  that  a  man  grows  accustomed  to  his own  body  or  to  an  old  ailment.  Without  much  caring, I  am  aware  that  I  am  going  to  die  soon;  I must,  consequently,  control  my  digressive  tendencies and  get  on  with  my  story. 
The  years  do  not  change  our  essential  selves — if one  has  an  essential  self.  The  impulse  that  would one  night  lead  me  to  the  Congress  of  the  World was  the  same  that  first  brought  me  to  the  staff  of Ultima  Hora.  To  a  poor  boy  from  the  provinces, becoming  a  newspaperman  was  a  romantic  fate, just  as  to  a  poor  city  boy  the  life  of  a  gaucho  or  a farmhand  is  romantic.  I  feel  no  shame  at  having once  wanted  to  be  a  journalist,  an  occupation  that now  seems  trivial  to  me.  I  remember  having  heard my  colleague  Fernandez  Irala  say  that  newspapermen wrote  for  oblivion  but  that  his  ambition  was to  write  for  time  and  for  memory.  He  had  already chiseled  (the  verb  was  then  in  common  use)  some of  those  perfect  sonnets  that  were  later  to  reappear, with  one  or  two  minor  touches,  in  the  pages of  The  Marble  Pillars. 
I  cannot  quite  recall  the  first  time  I  heard  the Congress  spoken  of.  Maybe  it  was  on  that  same evening  the  cashier  paid  me  my  first  month's  salary and,  to  celebrate  this  proof  that  Buenos  Aires had  taken  me  to  its  bosom,  I  suggested  to  Irala that  we  dine  together.  He  excused  himself,  saying he  could  not  miss  the  Congress.  I  understood  at once  that  he  was  not  referring  to  the  rather  pompous, domed  building  at  the  foot  of  an  avenue  peopled by  Spaniards  but  to  something  more  secret and  far  more  important.  People  spoke  of  the  Congress, some  with  open  scorn,  others  with  lowered voices,  still  others  with  alarm  or  curiosity — all,  I believe,  without  knowing  anything  about  it.  A  few Saturdays  later,  Irala  invited  me  to  go  along  with him. 
It  must  have  been  nine  or  ten  o'clock  at  night. On  our  way,  in  a  streetcar,  he  told  me  these  preliminary meetings  took  place  every  Saturday  and that  don  Alejandro  Glencoe,  the  president  of  the Congress,  perhaps  struck  by  my  name,  had  already signed  his  approval  of  my  attendance.  We went  to  the  Gas-Lamp  Coffee  House.  Some  fifteen or  twenty  members  of  the  Congress  sat  around  a long  table;  I  don't  know  if  there  was  a  dais  or  if memory  adds  it.  I  immediately  recognized  the president,  whom  I  had  never  seen  before.  Don Alejandro  was  a  gentleman,  already  well  along  in years,  with  a  high  forehead  and  thinning  hair, gray  eyes,  and  a  graying  reddish  beard.  I  always saw  him  dressed  in  a  dark  frock  coat,  and  he usually  held  his  hands  locked  together  over  the head  of  his  cane.  He  was  portly  and  tall.  To  his left  sat  a  much  younger  man,  also  with  red  hair. Its  violent  color  suggested  fire,  while  the  color  of Mr.  Glencoe's  beard  suggested  autumn  leaves.  To his  right  was  a  long-faced  young  man  with  an  unusually low  forehead  and  dressed  like  a  dandy.  Everyone had  ordered  coffee,  and  several  absinthe. What  first  caught  my  attention  was  the  presence  of a  woman — the  only  woman  among  so  many  men. At  the  other  end  of  the  table  sat  a  boy  of  about ten,  dressed  in  a  sailor  suit,  who  was  not  long  in falling  asleep.  There  were  also  a  Protestant  minister, two  unmistakable  Jews,  and  a  Negro,  who, with  a  white  silk  handkerchief  around  his  neck and  very  tight-fitting  clothes,  was  dressed  like  a street-corner  hoodlum.  In  front  of  the  Negro  and the  boy  were  cups  of  chocolate.  I  do  not  remember any  of  the  other  people  except  for  a  Mr. Marcelo  del  Mazo,  a  man  of  great  politeness  and fine  conversation,  whom  I  never  saw  again.  (I  still have  a  faded,  poorly  done  photograph  of  one  of the  gatherings,  but  I  shall  not  publish  it,  since  the dress,  the  long  hair,  and  the  mustaches  of  that period  would  make  the  whole  thing  look  burlesque and  even  shabby.) 
All  groups  tend  to  create  their  own  dialects  and rites;  the  Congress,  which  always  had  something dreamlike  about  it,  seemed  to  want  its  members  to discover — at  leisure  and  for  themselves — its  real aim  and  even  the  names  and  surnames  of  its  members. I  was  not  long  in  realizing  that  I  was  dutybound  not  to  ask  questions,  and  I  refrained  even from  asking  any  of  Fernandez  Irala,  who  never told  me  a  thing.  I  did  not  miss  a  single  Saturday, but  a  good  month  or  two  went  by  before  I  reached this  understanding.  From  the  second  meeting  on, my  neighbor  was  Donald  Wren,  an  engineer  on  the Southern  Railways,  who  was  to  give  me  English lessons. 
Don  Alejandro  spoke  very  little.  The  rest  did not  address  themselves  directly  to  him,  but  I  felt that  their  words  were  meant  for  him  and  that  everyone was  after  his  approval.  One  gesture  of  his slow  hand  was  enough  to  change  the  topic  of  discussion. I  came  to  find  out,  little  by  little,  that  the red-haired  man  to  his  left  bore  the  strange  name of  Twirl.  I  remember  that  fragile  look  of  his, which,  as  though  their  stature  made  them  dizzy and  forced  them  to  hunch  forward,  is  characteristic of  some  very  tall  people.  His  hand,  I  recall, often  played  with  a  copper  compass  case,  which from  time  to  time  he  set  on  the  table.  At  the  end of  1914,  he  was  killed  as  an  infantryman  in  an Irish  regiment.  The  person  who  always  sat  to  the right,  the  young  man  with  the  low  forehead,  was Fermin  Eguren,  the  president's  nephew. 
Putting  no  faith  in  the  methods  of  realism  (a most  artificial  school  if  there  ever  was  one),  I  shall declare  right  off  what  I  learned  only  little  by  little. Beforehand,  I  want  to  remind  the  reader  of  my situation  at  the  time.  I  was  a  poor  boy  from  Casilda,  a  farmer's  son,  who  had  come  to  the  capital and  suddenly  found  himself — this  was  the  way  I felt — in  the  intimate  heart  of  Buenos  Aires  and perhaps  (who  knows?)  of  the  whole  world.  After half  a  century,  I  still  feel  those  first  dazzling  moments, which  certainly  were  not  to  be  the  last. 
Here  are  the  facts.  I  shall  tell  them  as  briefly  as  I can.  Don  Alejandro  Glencoe,  the  president,  was  an Uruguayan  rancher  and  owner  of  a  large  spread of  land  bordering  on  Brazil.  His  father,  a  native  of Aberdeen,  had  established  himself  on  this  continent around  the  middle  of  the  last  century.  He brought  with  him  some  hundred  books — the  only books,  I  venture  to  say,  that  don  Alejandro  read  in the  course  of  his  life.  (I  speak  of  these  assorted books,  which  I  have  had  in  my  hands,  because  in one  of  them  lies  the  root  of  my  story.)  The  elder Mr.  Glencoe,  on  dying,  left  a  daughter  and  a  son. The  son  was  later  to  become  our  president;  the daughter  married  an  Eguren  and  was  Fermin's mother.  Don  Alejandro  at  one  time  aspired  to  the Uruguayan  National  Congress,  but  the  political bosses  barred  his  way.  Rankled,  he  decided  to found  another  Congress  and  on  a  vaster  scale.  He remembered  having  read  in  the  volcanic  pages  of Carlyle  the  fate  of  Anacharsis  Clootz,  that worshiper  of  the  goddess  Reason  who,  at  the  head of  thirty-six  foreigners,  addressed  a  Paris  assembly as  "mankind's  spokesman."  Moved  by  this  example, don  Alejandro  conceived  the  idea  of  calling together  a  Congress  of  the  World  that  would  represent all  men  of  all  nations.  The  center  for  the preliminary  meetings  was  the  Gas-Lamp  Coffee House;  the  formal  act  of  inauguration,  which would  take  place  within  some  four  years,  would  be held  at  don  Alejandro's  ranch.  Like  so  many Uruguayans,  don  Alejandro — who  was  no  lover  of Uruguay's  now  national  hero,  Artigas — was  fond of  Buenos  Aires,  but  he  nonetheless  decided  that the  Congress  must  eventually  meet  in  his  own country.  Oddly  enough,  the  four-year  planning period  was  carried  out  with  a  precision  that  was  almost magical. 
In  the  beginning,  we  were  paid  a  considerable sum  as  a  per  diem,  but  the  zeal  that  enflamed  us prompted  Fernandez  Irala — who  was  as  poor  as  I was — to  renounce  his,  and  all  the  rest  of  us  followed suit.  This  measure  was  healthy,  since  it served  to  separate  the  wheat  from  the  chaff;  the number  of  members  was  reduced,  and  only  the faithful  remained.  The  one  paid  position  was  that of  the  secretary,  Nora  Erfjord,  who  lacked  other means  of  support  and  whose  work  at  the  same time  was  staggering.  To  set  up  a  worldwide  organization is  no  trifling  enterprise.  Letters  came  and went,  and  so  did  cables  and  telegrams.  Potential delegates  wrote  from  Peru,  Denmark,  and  India. A  Bolivian  wrote  that  his  country's  lack  of  access  to the  sea  should  be  a  matter  of  prime  consideration in  our  first  meetings.  Twirl,  who  had  a  farseeing mind,  remarked  that  the  Congress  involved  a problem  of  a  philosophical  nature.  Planning  an  assembly to  represent  all  men  was  like  fixing  the exact  number  of  platonic  types — a  puzzle  that  had taxed  the  imagination  of  thinkers  for  centuries. Twirl  suggested  that,  without  going  farther  afield, don  Alejandro  Glencoe  might  represent  not  only cattlemen  but  also  Uruguayans,  and  also  humanity's great   forerunners,   and   also  men  with   red beards,  and  also  those  who  are  seated  in  armchairs. Nora  Erfjord  was  Norwegian.  Would  she represent  secretaries,  Norwegian  womanhood, or — more  obviously — all  beautiful  women?  Would a  single  engineer  be  enough  to  represent  all engineers — including  those  of  New  Zealand? 
It  was  then,  I  believe,  that  Fermin  broke  in. "Ferri  represents  the  gringos,"  he  said  in  a  flood of  laughter. 
Don  Alejandro  looked  at  him  severely  and,  in  an even  voice,  said,  "Mr.  Ferri  is  representative  of  the immigrants  whose  labor  is  building  up  this  country." " 
Fermin  Eguren  never  could  bear  the  sight  of me.  He  took  pride  in  an  assortment  of  things:  in being  Uruguayan;  in  coming  from  old  stock;  in  at- tracting women;  in  having  chosen  an  expensive tailor;  and,  God  knows  why,  in  his  Basque  origina  people  who  throughout  history  have  done  little else  than  milk  cows. 
An  incident  of  the  most  trivial  sort  sealed  our enmity.  After  one  of  the  meetings,  Eguren  suggested that  we  pay  a  visit  to  one  of  the  Junin  Street brothels.  The  plan  did  not  attract  me,  but,  in order  not  to  make  myself  the  butt  of  his  jokes,  I accepted.  We  went  with  Fernandez  Irala.  On  leaving the  establishment,  we  ran  into  a  huge  specimen of  a  man.  Eguren,  who  may  have  been  a  bit  drunk, gave  him  a  shove.  The  stranger  quickly  barred  our way  and  told  us,  "Whoever  wants  to  leave  is  going to  have  to  pass  by  this  knife." 
I  remember  the  glint  of  the  blade  in  the  darkness of  the  long  entranceway.  Eguren  drew  back, visibly  afraid.  I  wasn't  too  sure  of  myself,  but  my hatred  got  the  best  of  my  fright.  I  reached  into  my armpit,  as  if  to  draw  out  a  weapon,  and  said  in  a firm  voice,  "We'll  settle  this  out  on  the  street." 
The  stranger  answered — with  another  voice now,  "That's  the  kind  of  man  I  like.  I  wanted  to test  you,  friend."  Then  he  began  to  laugh  in  a  cordial way. 
"As  to  'friend,'  "  I  answered  him,  "that's  what you  think."  The  three  of  us  made  our  way  past him. 
The  man  with  the  knife  entered  the  brothel.  I heard  later  that  his  name  was  Tapia,  or  Paredes, or  something  of  the  kind,  and  that  he  had  a  reputation for  brawling.  Out  on  the  sidewalk,  Irala, who  had  kept  cool,  slapped  me  on  the  back  and said,  impressively,  "Among  us  three,  we  had  a musketeer.  Hail,  d'Artagnan!" 
Fermin  Eguren  never  forgave  me  for  having witnessed  his  backing  down. 
I  feel  that  now,  and  only  now,  my  story  begins. The  preceding  pages  have  set  down  no  more  than the  conditions  that  chance  or  fate  required  so  that the  unbelievable  event — perhaps  the  single  event of  my  whole  life — might  take  place.  Don  Alejandro Glencoe  was  always  at  the  center  of  the  Congress, but  over  a  period  of  time  we  felt,  not  without misgiving,  that  the  real  president  was  Twirl. This  singular  character,  with  the  flaming  mustache, fawned  on  Glencoe  and  even  on  Fermin Eguren — but  in  such  an  exaggerated  way  that those  present  would  think  he  was  actually  mocking the  two.  By  so  doing,  he  never  once  compromised his  integrity.  Glencoe  labored  under  the  pride  of his  vast  fortune;  Twirl  discovered  that  in  order  to get  anything  done  it  was  enough  to  suggest  that  its cost  might  prove  beyond  the  president's  means.  It is  my  suspicion  that  at  the  outset  the  Congress  had been  nothing  more  than  a  haphazard  sort  of name.  Twirl  was  continually  proposing  new  areas of  expansion,  and  don  Alejandro  always  accepted. It  was  like  being  at  the  middle  of  a  spreading  circle, which  grows  ever  larger  and  always  farther away.  Twirl  said,  for  example,  that  the  Congress could  not  get  along  without  a  reference  library, and  Nierenstein,  who  worked  in  a  bookshop,  went about  ordering  us  the  atlases  of  Justus  Perthes  and several  extensive  encyclopedias — all  the  way  from Pliny's  Natural  History  and  Beauvais'  Speculum down  to  the  pleasant  mazes  (I  reread  these  words with  Fernandez  Irala's  voice)  of  the  illustrious French  Encyclopedists,  of  the  Bi  itannica,  of  Pierre Larousse,  of  Brockhaus,  of  Larsen,  and  of  Montaner  y  Simon.  I  recall  how  I  reverently  fondled the  silky  volumes  of  a  certain  Chinese  encyclopedia whose  finely  brushed  characters seemed  to  me  more  mysterious  than  the  spots  on  a leopard's  skin.  As  yet,  I  will  say  nothing  of  what lay  in  store  for  them  and  which  certainly  I  do  not regret. 
Don  Alejandro,  maybe  because  we  were  the  only ones  who  did  not  try  to  flatter  him,  had  grown quite  fond  of  Fernandez  Irala  and  me.  He  invited us  to  spend  a  few  days  at  his  ranch,  La  Caledonia, where  he  had  a  crew  of  stonemasons  already  at work. 
At  the  end  of  a  long  trip  upriver  by  steamer  and a  ferry  crossing  on  a  raft,  we  set  foot  one  morning on  the  Uruguay  shore.  We  then  had  to  spend  successive nights  in  run-down  country  saloons,  while opening  and  shutting  dozens  of  gateways  all  day along  back  roads  in  the  Cuchilla  Negra.  We  made our  way  in  a  light  carriage;  the  countryside seemed  wider  and  lonelier  to  me  than  the  small farm  where  I  was  born. 
I  still  hold  my  two  images  of  the  ranch — the  one I  brought  with  me  and  the  one  my  eyes  finally  saw. Absurdly,  I  had  imagined,  as  in  a  dream,  an  impossible combination  of  the  flat  plains  of  Santa  Fe and  of  the  rather  gaudy  Victorian  Buenos  Aires Waterworks.  La  Caledonia  was  a  long  adobe  building with  a  thatched  saddle  roof  and  a  brick-paved gallery.  It  appeared  to  be  built  for  hardship  and endurance.  The  rough  walls  were  nearly  a  yard thick  and  the  doors  were  narrow.  Nobody  had ever  thought  of  planting  a  tree.  The  sun's  first  and last  rays  beat  down  on  the  place.  The  corrals  were of  stone;  the  cattle  were  many,  scrawny  and  longhorned;  the  horses'  switching  tails  reached  the ground.  For  the  first  time  in  my  life,  I  knew  the taste  of  freshly  slaughtered  meat.  Some  sacks  of sea  biscuit  were  brought  out;  a  few  days  later,  the foreman  told  me  he  had  never  eaten  bread  in  his life.  Irala  asked  where  the  bathroom  was,  and, with  a  sweeping  gesture,  don  Alejandro  indicated the  entire  continent.  It  was  a  moonlit  night;  I  went out  to  stretch  my  legs,  and  I  surprised  Irala  being watched  by  an  ostrich. 
The  heat,  which  the  night  had  not  dispelled,  was unbearable,  and  everyone  praised  the  coolness. The  rooms  were  low-ceilinged  and  many,  and seemed  to  me  barely  furnished;  we  were  given  one, facing  south,  in  which  there  were  two  cots  and  a dresser  with  a  silver  washbasin  and  pitcher.  The floor  was  dirt. The  second  day,  I  came  across  the  library  and the  volumes  of  Carlyle,  and  I  found  the  pages dedicated  to  mankind's  spokesman,  Anacharsis Clootz,  who  had  led  me  to  that  morning  and  to that  loneliness.  After  breakfast,  which  was  identical with  dinner,  don  Alejandro  showed  us  the building  under  construction.  We  rode  three  or four  miles  on  horseback  out  in  the  wide  open. Irala,  whose  horsemanship  was  shaky,  had  an  accident; unsmiling,  the  foreman  remarked,  "You Argentines  really  know  how  to  dismount." 
From  way  off,  we  could  see  the  construction  site. Some  twenty  men  were  at  work  building  a  kind  of tumbledown  amphitheater.  I  recall  a  series  of stages  and  ladders  and  stone  tiers  with  stretches  of sky  showing  between. 
More  than  once,  I  tried  to  speak  with  the  gauchos,  but  my  efforts  failed.  In  some  way,  they knew  they  were  different.  Among  themselves,  they used  a  spare,  guttural  Brazilianized  Spanish.  It was  obvious  that  both  Indian  and  Negro  blood  ran in  their  veins.  They  were  short  and  strong;  at  La Caledonia,  I  became  a  tall  man — something  that had  never  happened  to  me  until  then. 
Almost  all  of  them  dressed  with  their  legs wrapped  in  the  chiripd,  and  a  few  wore  the  wide, baggy  bombachas.  They  had  little  or  nothing  in common  with  the  complaining  heroes  found  in  the books  of  Hernandez  or  of  Rafael  Obligado.  Under the  stimulus  of  Saturday-night  alcohol,  they  were easily  moved  to  violence.  There  wasn't  a  single woman  around,  and  I  never  once  heard  a  guitar. 
I  was  more  interested  in  the  change  that  had come  over  don  Alejandro  than  I  was  in  these border-country  men.  In  Buenos  Aires,  he  was  a pleasant,  reserved  gentleman;  at  La  Caledonia, like  his  fathers  before  him,  he  became  the  stern chief  of  a  clan.  Sunday  mornings,  he  read  Holy Scripture  to  the  hands,  who  did  not  understand  a single  word.  One  night,  the  foreman,  a  youngish man  who  had  inherited  the  job  from  his  father,  reported to  us  that  one  of  the  day  laborers  and  one of  the  regular  help  were  having  it  out  with  knives. Don  Alejandro  got  up,  unruffled.  When  he  came to  the  circle  of  onlookers,  he  drew  out  the  weapon he  always  carried,  handed  it  to  the  foreman  (who appeared  to  me  to  cringe),  and  stepped  between the  knives.  At  once,  I  heard  the  order,  "Drop those  knives,  boys."  With  the  same  calm  voice,  he added,  "Now  shake  hands  and  behave  yourselves. I  don't  want  any  brawling  around  here." 
The  two  men  obeyed.  The  next  day,  I  learned that  don  Alejandro  had  fired  the  foreman. 
I  felt  the  loneliness  ringing  me  in,  and  I  began fearing  I'd  never  get  back  to  Buenos  Aires.  I wonder  whether  Fernandez  Irala  shared  that  fear. We  talked  a  lot  about  Argentina  and  what  we'd  do when  we  returned.  I  missed  the  stone  lions  of  a certain  gateway  on  Jujuy  Street,  near  the  Plaza  del Once,  and  the  light  of  a  particular  old  bar  in  some dim  part  of  town,  but  not  my  familiar  haunts. Always  a  good  rider,  I  fell  into  the  habit  of  going out  on  horseback  and  riding  long  distances.  I  still remember  the  particular  piebald  I  used  to  saddle up  myself.  On  some  afternoon  or  on  some  night or  other,  I  probably  was  in  Brazil,  since  the  border was  nothing  but  a  line  traced  out  by  widely  spaced markers.  Then,  at  the  close  of  a  day  exactly  like  all the  rest,  don  Alejandro  told  us,  "We'll  turn  in early.  Tomorrow  we'll  be  off  while  it's  still  cool." 
Once  down  the  river,  I  felt  so  happy  that  I  was even  able  to  think  back  to  La  Caledonia  with  affection. 
We  took  up  our  Saturday  meetings  again.  At  the first  one,  Twirl  asked  for  the  floor.  He  said,  with his  usual  flowers  of  rhetoric,  that  the  library  of  the Congress  of  the  World  could  not  be  limited  to  reference books  alone,  and  that  the  classical  works  of all  nations  and  all  languages  were  a  veritable  storehouse that  we  could  not  safely  afford  to  ignore. The  suggestion  was  approved  on  the  spot;  Fernandez Irala  and  Dr.  Ignacio  Cruz,  who  was  a teacher  of  Latin,  accepted  the  job  of  selecting  the appropriate  texts.  Twirl  had  already  talked  things over  with  Nierenstein. 
In  those  days,  there  wasn't  a  single  Argentine whose  Utopia  was  not  Paris.  Perhaps  the  most  enthusiastic of  us  was  Fermin  Eguren;  next,  for  quite different  reasons,  came  Fernandez  Irala.  To  the poet  of  The  Marble  Pillars,  Paris  was  Verlaine  and Leconte  de  Lisle,  while  to  Eguren  it  was  an  improved version  of  Junin  Street.  I  suspect  that  he had  come  to  some  understanding  with  Twirl.  At  a subsequent  meeting,  Twirl  brought  up  the  question of  what  language  the  members  of  the Congress  would  use,  arguing  the  feasibility  of sending  delegates  to  London  and  Paris  to  gather information.  Feigning  impartiality,  he  first  put  up my  name,  and  then,  as  an  apparent  afterthought, that  of  his  friend  Eguren.  As  always,  don  Alejandro agreed. 
I  think  I  have  written  that,  in  exchange  for some  lessons  in  Italian,  Wren  had  initiated  me  into the  study  of  the  inexhaustible  English  language. 
As  far  as  possible,  we  did  away  with  grammar  and with  those  exercises  concocted  for  the  beginner, and  we  found  our  way  directly  into  poetry,  whose forms  demand  brevity.  My  first  contact  with  the language  that  was  to  fill  out  my  life  was  Stevenson's brave  "Requiem."  Then  came  the  ballads  that Percy  revealed  to  the  dignified  eighteenth  century. A  short  while  before  leaving  for  London,  I  was dazzled  by  Swinburne — an  experience  that  made me  begin  to  doubt  (and  to  feel  guilty  about  it)  the eminence  of  Irala's  alexandrines. 
I  reached  London  early  in  January,  1902;  I  remember the  soft  touch  of  falling  snow,  which  I had  never  before  seen  and  for  which  I  was  grateful. Luckily,  Eguren  and  I  had  traveled  separately. I  roomed  at  a  modest  boarding  house  behind  the British  Museum,  where  mornings  and  afternoons I  studied  in  the  library  in  search  of  a  language worthy  of  the  Congress  of  the  World.  I  did  not overlook  universal  languages,  investigating  both Esperanto — which  Lugones  qualifies  as  "impartial, simple,  and  economical" — and  Volaptik,  which, declining  verbs  and  conjugating  nouns,  attempts to  work  out  all  linguistic  possibilities.  I  also weighed  the  arguments  in  favor  of  and  against  the revival  of  Latin,  a  nostalgia  for  which  has  endured down  through  the  centuries.  I  even  dwelled  on  an examination  of  John  Wilkins'  analytical  language, in  which  the  definition  of  each  word  is  to  be  found in  the  letters  that  spell  it  out.  It  was  beneath  the high  dome  of  the  reading  room  that  I  first  met Beatrice. 
This  is  meant  to  be  a  general  history  of  the Congress  of  the  World,  not  of  Alejandro  Ferri,  but the  former  takes  in  the  latter,  just  as  it  takes  in  all other  histories.  Beatrice  was  tall,  trim,  with  fine features  and  a  head  of  red  hair  that  might  have reminded  me — but  never  did — of  the  shady  Twirl. She  was  not  yet  twenty.  She  had  come  down  from one  of  the  northern  counties  to  study  literature  at the  university.  Her  background,  like  mine,  was humble.  At  that  time,  to  be  of  Italian  stock  in Buenos  Aires  was  still  to  be  looked  down  on,  but in  London  I  found  out  that  being  Italian  was  to many  people  a  romantic  attribute.  Within  a  few evenings,  we  were  lovers;  I  asked  her  to  marry  me, but  Beatrice  Frost,  like  Nora  Erfjord,  was  a  follower of  the  faith  preached  by  Ibsen,  and  she  did not  want  to  tie  herself  down  to  anyone.  From  her lips  came  the  word  I  never  dared  speak.  O  nights, O  darkness  warm  and  shared,  O  love  that  flows  in shadows  like  some  secret  river,  O  that  instant  of ecstasy  when  each  is  both,  O  that  ecstasy's  purity and  innocence,  O  the  coupling  in  which  we  became lost  so  as  then  to  lose  ourselves  in  sleep,  O the  first  light  of  dawn,  and  I  watching  her. 
On  the  rough  Brazil  border,  I  had  been  plagued by  homesickness;  not  so  in  London's  red  labyrinth, which  gave  me  so  many  things.  Despite  the  pretexts I  dreamed  up  to  delay  my  departure,  I  had to  return  home  at  the  end  of  the  year.  Beatrice and  I  celebrated  Christmas  together.  I  assured  her that  don  Alejandro  would  invite  her  to  join  the Congress;  she  answered,  in  an  offhand  way,  that she  had  always  wanted  to  visit  the  Southern  Hemisphere, and  that  a  cousin  of  hers,  a  dentist,  had settled  in  Tasmania. 
Beatrice  did  not  want  to  come  to  the  boat. Goodbyes,  to  her  way  of  thinking,  were  too  dramatic,  were  a  senseless  feast  of  unhappiness,  and she  detested  dramatics.  We  parted  in  the  library, where  we  had  met  the  winter  before.  As  a  man, I'm  a  coward;  to  avoid  the  anguish  of  waiting  for letters,  I  did  not  leave  her  my  address. 
Return  trips  are  shorter,  I  have  always  noticed, but  that  crossing  of  the  Atlantic,  heavy  with  memories and  anxieties,  seemed  unusually  long.  Nothing hurt  me  as  much  as  thinking  that,  in  a  parallel with  my  life,  Beatrice  would  go  on  living  hers, minute  by  minute  and  night  by  night.  I  wrote  a lengthy  letter,  destroying  it  as  we  left  Montevideo. When  I  reached  Argentina — it  was  on  a Thursday — Irala  was  waiting  for  me  at  the  dock.  I went  back  to  my  old  place  on  Chile  Street;  that  day and  the  next  he  and  I  spent  together  talking  and taking  long  walks.  I  wanted  to  recover  Buenos Aires  again.  It  was  a  relief  to  find  out  that  Fermin Eguren  was  staying  on  in  Paris;  I  knew  the  fact  of my  having  come  back  before  him  would  in  some way  make  up  for  my  long  absence. 
Irala  was  downcast.  Fermin  was  squandering huge  sums  in  Europe  and  had  more  than  once  disobeyed the  order  to  return  home.  This  was  to have  been  foreseen.  I  was  more  disturbed  by  other news.  Twirl,  in  spite  of  the  opposition  of  Irala  and Cruz,  had  invoked  the  Younger  Pliny,  according to  whom  there  is  no  book  so  bad  it  does  not  contain some  good,  and  had  proposed  the  indiscriminate purchase  of  bound  volumes  of  the  daily press,  of  thirty-four  hundred  copies  of  Don  Quixote in  various  editions,  of  the  complete  works  of  General Mitre,  of  Ph.D.  theses,  of  old  account  books, of  bulletins,  and  of  theater  programs.  Everything gives  witness,  he  had  said.  Nierenstein  backed him;  don  Alejandro,  "after  three  resounding  Saturdays" (as  Irala  put  it),  approved  the  motion. Nora  Erfjord  had  resigned  her  position  as  secretary; it  was  taken  over  by  a  new  member,  Karlinski,  who  was  a  tool  of  Twirl's.  The  bulky  packages began  piling  up  now,  without  files  or  catalogs, in  the  back  rooms  and  in  the  wine  cellar  of  don Alejandro's  rambling  old  town  house.  Early  in Juh,  Irala  spent  a  week  back  at  La  Caledonia, where  the  masons  had  broken  off  their  work.  The foreman,  upon  questioning,  explained  that  that was  what  the  boss  had  ordered,  and  that  there would  always  be  time  enough  tomorrow. 
In  London,  I  had  drafted  a  report  that  there  is now  no  point  in  going  into.  That  Friday,  I  went  to pay  a  visit  to  don  Alejandro  and  to  deliver  a  copy of  what  I  had  written.  Fernandez  Irala  came  with me.  It  was  early  evening,  and  the  cold  south  wind blew  into  the  house.  At  the  front  gate,  on  Alsina Street,  a  delivery  wagon,  pulled  by  three  horses, stood  waiting.  I  remember  that  the  deliverymen were  weighed  down  under  the  loads  they  went about  piling  up  in  the  last  patio.  Twirl  was  imperious, giving  them  orders.  Also  present,  indoors,  as if  they  had  had  an  inkling  of  something,  were Nora  Erfjord  and  Nierenstein  and  Cruz  and  Donald Wren  and  a  few  other  members  of  the  Congress. Nora  threw  her  arms  around  me  and  kissed me,  and  that  embrace  and  that  kiss  made  me  remember others.  The  Negro,  brimming  over  with good  nature  and  happiness,  kissed  my  hand. 
In  one  of  the  rooms,  the  square  trapdoor  to  the cellar  was  wide  open;  some  masonry  steps  plunged down  into  darkness.  Suddenly  we  heard  footsteps. 
Before  laying  eyes  on  him,  I  knew  it  was  don  Alejandro. He  came  almost  on  the  run. 
His  voice  was  different.  It  was  not  the  voice  of the  deliberate  gentleman  who  presided  over  our Saturdays,  nor  that  of  the  feudal  landowner  who had  put  a  stop  to  a  knife  duel  and  who  preached the  word  of  God  to  his  gauchos — but  it  seemed more  like  this  latter. 
Without  looking  at  anyone,  he  ordered,  "Get  everything out  that's  packed  away  down  there.  I don't  want  a  single  book  left  in  that  cellar." 
The  work  went  on  for  nearly  an  hour.  Outside, on  the  earth  floor  of  the  last  patio,  we  made  a  pile that  was  taller  than  the  tallest  head.  All  of  us marched  back  and  forth;  the  only  person  who failed  to  move  was  don  Alejandro. 
Then  came  the  order,  "Now  set  fire  to  that heap." 
Twirl  went  pale.  Nierenstein  blurted,  "How  can the  Congress  of  the  World  do  without  this  valuable material  I've  collected  with  so  much  love?" 
"The  Congress  of  the  World?"  said  don  Alejandro. He  laughed  scornfully.  I  had  never  before heard  him  laugh. 
There  is  a  mysterious  pleasure  in  destruction. The  flames  crackled  brightly,  and  we  all  had  to press  back  against  the  walls  or  move  indoors. Darkness,  ashes,  and  an  odor  of  burning  were  left behind  in  the  patio.  I  remember  some  undamaged pages  lying  white  against  the  ground.  Nora  Erfjord,  who  felt  for  don  Alejandro  that  love  which young  women  often  feel  for  older  men,  said,  without really  understanding,  "Don  Alejandro  knows what  he's  doing." 
Irala,  always  true  to  literature,  attempted  an  epigram.  "Every  few  centuries,"  he  said,  "the  Library of  Alexandria  must  be  burned  down." 
Then  the  revelation  was  made  to  us. 
"It  has  taken  me  four  years  to  understand  what I  am  about  to  say,"  don  Alejandro  began.  "My friends,  the  undertaking  we  have  set  for  ourselves is  so  vast  that  it  embraces — I  now  see — the  whole world.  Our  Congress  cannot  be  a  group  of  charla- tans deafening  each  other  in  the  sheds  of  an  out- of-the-way  ranch.  The  Congress  of  the  World began  with  the  first  moment  of  the  world  and  it will  go  on  when  we  are  dust.  There's  no  place  on earth  where  it  does  not  exist.  The  Congress  is  the books  we've  burned.  The  Congress  is  Job  on  the ash  heap  and  Christ  on  the  Cross.  The  Congress  is that  worthless  boy  who  squanders  my  substance  on whores." 
I  could  not  hold  myself  back.  "Don  Alejandro," I  broke  in,  "I,  too,  am  to  blame.  I  had  finished  my report,  which  I  now  hand  you,  but  I  stayed  on  and on  in  England,  throwing  your  money  away  on  a woman." 
Don  Alejandro  went  on.  "I  had  already  guessed as  much,  Ferri.  The  Congress  is  my  cattle.  The Congress  is  the  cattle  I  have  sold  and  the  miles  of land  that  are  no  longer  mine." 
A  horror-stricken  voice  was  raised — Twirl's. "You  don't  mean  to  say  you've  sold  La  Caledonia?" 
"Yes,"  don  Alejandro  said  calmly,  "I've  sold  it.  I haven't  a  square  foot  of  land  to  my  name,  but  I  do not  regret  it,  because  now  I  see  things  as  they  are. 
Perhaps  we  shall  never  meet  again,  for  the Congress  stands  in  no  need  of  us.  But  this  last night  we  will  all  go  out  together  to  see  the  true Congress." 
Drunk  with  victory,  he  overwhelmed  us  with  his resolution  and  faith.  No  one — not  for  a  single  second— thought  he  was  mad. 
In  the  square,  we  climbed  into  an  open  carriage. I  squeezed  myself  onto  the  driver's  seat  beside  the coachman,  and  don  Alejandro  ordered,  "Maestro, let's  have  a  turn  around  the  city.  Take  us  anywhere you  like." 
The  Negro,  perched  on  the  running  board, never  stopped  smiling.  I'll  never  know  whether  or not  he  realized  what  was  going  on. 
Words  are  symbols  that  assume  a  shared  memory. The  memory  I  now  want  to  set  down  is  mine alone;  all  those  who  share  it  have  died.  The  mystics invoke  a  rose,  a  kiss,  a  bird  that  is  all  birds,  a sun  that  is  all  the  stars  and  the  sun,  a  jug  of  wine, a  garden,  or  the  sexual  act.  Of  these  metaphors, none  will  serve  me  for  that  long,  joyous  night, which  left  us,  tired  out  and  happy,  at  the  borders of  dawn.  We  barely  spoke  while  the  wheels  and the  horses'  hooves  clattered  over  the  cobblestones. Before  daybreak,  beside  a  dark,  humble  body  of water  that  may  have  been  the  Maldonado  or  the Riachuelo,  Nora  Erfjord's  high  voice  sang  the  ballad of  Sir  Patrick  Spens,  and  don  Alejandro,  in  a low  voice  and  out  of  tune,  chimed  in  with  a  few verses.  The  English  words  did  not  bring  me  Beatrice's image.  At  my  back,  Twirl  muttered,  "I wanted  to  do  evil  and  I  have  done  good." Something  of  what  we  glimpsed  lives  on — the reddish  wall  of  the  Recoleta  cemetery,  the  yellow wall  of  a  jail,  a  couple  of  men  dancing  together  at a  right-angled  street  corner,  a  church  courtyard with  black  and  white  tiles  and  a  grilled  iron  fence, a  railway  gate  crossing,  my  house,  a  marketplace, the  damp  unfathomable  night — but  none  of  these fleeting  things,  which  may  have  been  others,  now matter.  What  really  matters  is  having  felt  that  our plan,  which  more  than  once  we  made  a  joke  of,  really and  secretly  existed  and  was  the  world  and ourselves.  Down  through  the  years,  without  much hope,  I  have  sought  the  taste  of  that  night;  a  few times  I  thought  I  had  recaptured  it  in  music,  in love,  in  untrustworthy  memories,  but  it  has  never come  back  to  me  except  once  in  a  dream.  When we  swore  not  to  say  a  word  to  anyone,  it  was  already Saturday  morning. 
I  never  saw  any  of  them  again,  outside  of  Irala. 
He  and  I  never  spoke  about  the  Congress;  anything we  might  have  said  would  have  been  a  desecration. In  1914,  don  Alejandro  Glencoe  died  and was  buried  in  Montevideo.  Irala  had  already passed  away  the  year  before. 
Once,  I  ran  across  Nierenstein  on  Lima  Street, and  we  pretended  not  to  see  each  other. 
There  Are  More  Things 
To  the  memory  of  H.  P.  Lovecraft 
On  the  point  of  taking  my  last  examination  at  the University  of  Texas,  in  Austin,  I  learned  that  my uncle  Edwin  Arnett  had  died  of  an  aneurysm  at the  far  end  of  the  South  American  continent.  I  felt what  we  all  feel  when  someone  dies — the  remorse, now  pointless,  for  not  having  been  kinder.  We forget  that  we  are  all  dead  men  conversing  with dead  men.  My  course  of  study  was  philosophy.  I remembered  that  it  was  my  uncle,  at  the  Casa Colorada,  his  home  near  Lomas,  on  the  edge  of Buenos  Aires,  who,  without  invoking  a  single proper  name,  had  first  revealed  to  me  philosophy's beautiful  perplexities.  One  of  the  afterdinner  oranges  was  his  aid  in  initiating  me  into Berkeley's  idealism;  a  chessboard  was  enough  to  illustrate the  paradoxes  of  the  Eleatics.  Years  later, he  was  to  lend  me  Hinton's  treatises  which  attempt to  demonstrate  the  reality  of  four-dimensional space  and  which  the  reader  is  meant  to  imagine  by means  of  complicated  exercises  with  multicolored cubes.  I  shall  never  forget  the  prisms  and  pyramids that  we  erected  on  the  floor  of  his  study. My  uncle  was  an  engineer.  Before  retiring  from his  job  with  the  railroad,  he  decided  to  build  himself a  house  in  Turdera,  which  offered  the  advantages of  almost  countrylike  solitude  and  of  proximity to  the  city.  Nothing  was  more  predictable than  that  the  architect  should  be  his  close  friend Alexander  Muir.  This  uncompromising  man  followed the  uncompromising  teachings  of  John Knox.  My  uncle,  like  almost  all  the  gentlemen  of his  day,  had  been  a  freethinker  or,  rather,  an  agnostic, but  he  was  interested  in  theology,  just  as  he was  interested  in  Hinton's  unreal  cubes  and  in  the well-constructed  nightmares  of  the  young  H.  G. Wells.  He  liked  dogs,  and  he  had  a  great  sheepdog that  he  had  named  Samuel  Johnson,  in  memory  of Lichfield,  his  far-off  birthplace. 
The  Casa  Colorada  stood  on  a  height  of  land, bordered  on  the  west  by  sun-blackened  fields.  Inside its  fence,  the  araucarias  did  nothing  to  soften its  air  of  gloom.  Instead  of  a  flat  roof,  there  was  a slate-tiled  saddle  roof  and  a  square  tower  with  a clock.  These  seemed  to  oppress  the  walls  and  the meager  windows.  As  a  boy,  I  used  to  accept  all  this ugliness,  just  as  one  accepts  those  incompatible things  which,  only  because  they  coexist,  are  called the  world. 
I  returned  home  in  1921.  To  avoid  legal  complications, the  house  had  been  auctioned  off.  It  was bought  by  a  foreigner,  a  Max  Preetorius,  who  paid double  what  was  offered  by  the  highest  bidder.  No sooner  was  the  deed  signed  than  he  arrived,  late one  afternoon,  with  two  helpers  and  they  carted off  to  a  rubbish  dump,  not  far  from  the  old  Drover's Road,  all  the  furniture,  all  the  books,  and  all the  utensils  of  the  house.  (I  sadly  recalled  the  diagrams  in  the  Hinton  volumes  and  the  great  globe.) The  next  day,  Preetorius  went  to  Muir  and  proposed certain  alterations  that  the  architect  indignantly rejected.  In  the  end,  a  firm  from  Buenos Aires  took  charge  of  the  work.  The  local  carpenters refused  to  furnish  the  house  again.  Finally,  a certain  Mariani,  from  Glew,  accepted  the  conditions laid  down  by  Preetorius.  For  an  entire  fortnight he  had  to  labor  by  night  behind  closed  doors. It  was  also  bv  night  that  the  new  owner  of  the Casa  Colorada  moved  in.  The  windows  no  longer opened,  but  chinks  of  light  could  be  made  out  in the  dark.  One  morning,  the  milkman  found  the sheepdog  dead  on  the  walk,  headless  and  mutilated. That  winter  they  felled  the  araucarias.  Nobody saw  Preetorius  again. 
News  of  these  events,  as  may  be  imagined,  left me  uneasy.  I  know  that  my  most  obvious  trait  is curiosity — that  same  curiosity  that  brought  me together  with  a  woman  completely  different  from me  only  in  order  to  find  out  who  she  was  and  what she  was  like,  to  take  up  (without  appreciable  results) the  use  of  laudanum,  to  explore  transfinite numbers,  and  to  undertake  the  hideous  adventure that  I  am  about  to  tell.  Ominously,  I  decided  to look  into  the  matter. 
My  first  step  was  to  see  Alexander  Muir.  I  remembered him  as  tall-standing  and  dark,  with  a wiry  build  that  suggested  strength.  Now  the  years had  stooped  him  and  his  black  beard  had  gone gray.  He  received  me  at  his  Temperley  house, which,  foreseeably,  was  like  my  uncle's,  since  both houses  followed  the  solid  standards  of  the  good poet  and  bad  builder  William  Morris. 
Conversation    was    spare — Scotland's    symbol, after  all,  is  the  thistle.  I  had  the  feeling,  nonetheless, that  the  strong  Ceylon  tea  and  the  equally generous  plate  of  scones  (which  my  host  broke  in two  and  buttered  for  me  as  if  I  were  still  a  boy) were,  in  fact,  a  frugal  Calvinistic  feast  offered  to the  nephew  of  his  friend.  His  theological  differences with  my  uncle  had  been  a  long  game  of chess,  demanding  of  each  player  the  collaboration of  his  opponent. 
Time  passed  and  I  was  no  nearer  my  business. There  was  an  uncomfortable  silence  and  Muir spoke.  "Young  man,"  he  said,  "you  have  not  come all  this  way  to  talk  about  Edwin  or  the  United States,  a  country  that  I  have  little  interest  in. What's  troubling  you  is  the  sale  of  the  Casa  Colorada  and  its  odd  buyer.  They  do  me,  too. Frankly,  the  story  displeases  me,  but  I'll  tell  you what  I  can.  It  will  not  be  much." 
After  a  while  he  went  on,  unhurriedly.  "Before Edwin  died,  the  mayor  called  me  into  his  office. He  was  with  the  parish  priest.  They  asked  me  to draw  the  plans  for  a  Catholic  chapel.  My  work would  be  well  paid.  On  the  spot,  I  answered  no.  I am  a  servant  of  God  and  I  cannot  commit  the abomination  of  erecting  altars  to  idols."  Here  he stopped. 
"Is  that  all?"  I  finally  dared  ask. 
"No.  This  whelp  of  a  Jew  Preetorius  wanted  me to  destroy  my  work  and  in  its  place  get  up  a  monstrous thing.  Abomination  comes  in  many  shapes." He  pronounced  these  words  gravely  and  got  to  his feet. 
Outside,  on  turning  the  corner,  I  was  approached by  Daniel  Iberra.  We  knew  one  another the  way  people  in  small  towns  do.  He  suggested that  we  accompany  each  other  back  to  Turdera.  I have  never  been  keen  on  hoodlums,  and  I  expected a  sordid  litany  of  violent  and  more  or  less apocryphal  back-room  stories,  but  I  gave  in  and accepted  his  invitation.  It  was  nearly  nightfall.  On seeing  the  Casa  Colorada  come  into  view  from  a few  blocks  off,  Iberra  made  a  detour.  I  asked  him why.  His  reply  was  not  what  I  anticipated. 
"I  am  don  Felipe's  right  arm,"  he  said.  "Nobody has  ever  called  me  soft.  That  young  Urgoiti  who took  the  trouble  to  come  looking  for  me  all  the way  from  Merlo — you  probably  remember  what happened  to  him.  Look.  A  few  nights  ago,  I  was returning  from  a  party.  A  hundred  yards  or  so from  that  house  I  saw  something.  My  horse  reared up,  and  if  I  hadn't  had  a  good  grip  on  him  and made  him  turn  down  an  alley,  maybe  I  wouldn't be  telling  this  story  now.  What  I  saw  justified  the horse's  fright."  Angrily,  Iberra  added  a  swear word. 
That  night  I  did  not  sleep.  Around  dawn,  I dreamed  about  an  engraving  that  I  had  never  seen before  or  that  I  had  seen  and  forgotten;  it  was  in the  style  of  Piranesi,  and  it  had  a  labyrinth  in  it.  It was  a  stone  amphitheater  ringed  by  cypresses, above  whose  tops  it  reached.  There  were  neither doors  nor  windows;  rather,  it  displayed  an  endless row  of  narrow  vertical  slits.  With  a  magnifying glass,  I  tried  to  see  the  Minotaur  inside.  At  last,  I made  it  out.  It  was  a  monster  of  a  monster,  more bison  than  bull,  and,  its  human  body  stretched  out on  the  ground,  it  seemed  to  be  asleep  and  dreaming. Dreaming  of  what  or  of  whom? 
That  evening,  I  passed  by  the  Casa  Colorada. The  iron  gate  was  shut  and  some  of  its  bars  were bent.  What  once  was  garden  was  now  overgrown with  weeds.  To  the  right,  there  was  a  shallow  ditch and  its  outer  edges  were  trampled. 
There  was  only  one  move  left,  but  for  days  I kept  putting  it  off — not  because  I  felt  it  to  be  altogether a  waste,  but  because  it  would  drag  me  to the  inevitable,  to  the  last. 
Without  much  hope,  I  went  to  Glew.  Mariani, the  carpenter,  was  a  stout,  pink-faced  Italian,  common and  cordial  and  now  somewhat  advanced  in years.  A  glance  at  him  was  enough  for  me  to dismiss  the  stratagems  I  had  contrived  the  night before.  I  handed  him  my  card,  which  he  pompously spelled  out  aloud  with  a  certain  reverential stumbling  when  he  reached  the  "Ph.D."  I  told  him I  was  interested  in  the  furniture  made  by  him  for the  house  in  Turdera  that  had  been  my  uncle's. The  man  spoke  on  and  on.  I  shall  not  try  to  transcribe his  torrent  of  words  and  gestures,  but  he told  me  that  his  motto  was  to  satisfy  his  customer's every  demand,  no  matter  how  outlandish  it  was, and  that  he  had  carried  out  his  work  to  the  letter. After  rummaging  in  various  drawers  he  showed me  some  papers  that  I  could  make  neither  head nor  tail  of;  they  were  signed  by  the  elusive  Preetorius.  (Doubtless,  Mariani  mistook  me  for  a  lawyer.) On  saying  goodbye,  he  confided  to  me  that even  for  all  the  world's  gold  he  would  never  again set  foot  in  Turdera,  let  alone  that  house.  He added  that  the  customer  is  sacred,  but  that  in  his humble  opinion  Mr.  Preetorius  was  crazy.  Then he  grew  quiet,  obviously  repentant.  I  was  unable to  worm  anything  more  out  of  him.

      <p class="sand">
The  line  is  made  up  of  an  infinite  number  of points;  the  plane  of  an  infinite  number  of  lines; the  volume  of  an  infinite  number  of  planes;  the hypervolume  of  an  infinite  number  of  volumes. .  .  .  No,  unquestionably  this  is  not — more  geometrico — the  best  way  of  beginning  my  story.  To claim  that  it  is  true  is  nowadays  the  convention  of every  made-up  story.  Mine,  however,  is  true. 

I  live  alone  in  a  fourth-floor  apartment  on  Belgrano  Street,  in  Buenos  Aires.  Late  one  evening,  a few  months  back,  I  heard  a  knock  at  my  door.  I opened  it  and  a  stranger  stood  there.  He  was  a  tall man,  with  nondescript  features — or  perhaps  it  was my  myopia  that  made  them  seem  that  way. Dressed  in  gray  and  carrying  a  gray  suitcase  in  his hand,  he  had  an  unassuming  look  about  him.  I saw  at  once  that  he  was  a  foreigner.  At  first,  he struck  me  as  old;  only  later  did  I  realize  that  I  had been  misled  by  his  thin  blond  hair,  which  was,  in  a Scandinavian  sort  of  way,  almost  white.  During  the course  of  our  conversation,  which  was  not  to  last an  hour,  I  found  out  that  he  came  from  the  Orkneys.

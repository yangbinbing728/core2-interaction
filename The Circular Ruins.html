No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, 
no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud, 
but in a few days there was no one who did not know that the 
taciturn man came from the South and that his home had been one 
of those numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of 
the mountain, where the Zend language has not been contaminated 
by Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that 
the grey man kissed the mud,climbed up the bank with pushing aside
(probably, without feeling) the blades which were lacerating his 
flesh, and crawled,nauseated and bloodstained, up to the circular 
enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse, which sometimes was 
the color of flame and now was that of ashes. This circle was a 
temple which had been devoured by ancient fires,  profaned by the 
miasmal jungle, and whose god no longer received the homage of men. 
 The stranger stretched himself out beneath the pedestal. He was 
 awakened by the sun high overhead.  He was not astonished to find 
 that his wounds had healed; he closed his pallid eyes and slept, 
 not through weakness of flesh but through determination of will. 
 He knew that this temple was  the place required for his invincible 
 intent; he knew that the incessant trees had not succeeded in strangling 
 the ruins of another propitious temple downstream which had once belonged 
 to gods now burned and dead; he knew that his immediate obligation was to 
 dream. Toward midnight he was awakened by the inconsolable shriek of a 
 bird. Tracks of bare feet, some figs and a jug warned him that the 
 men of the region had been spying respectfully on his sleep, soliciting 
 his protection or afraid of his magic. He felt a chill of fear, and 
 sought out a sepulchral niche in the dilapidated wall where he concealed 
 himself among unfamiliar leaves.
      </p></section>

      <section class="segment"><p>
The purpose which guided him was not impossible, though supernatural. 
He wanted to dream a man; he wanted to dream him in minute entirety 
and impose him on reality. This magic project had exhausted the entire
 expanse of his mind; if someone had asked him his name or to relate 
 some event of his former life, he would not have been able to give an 
 answer. This uninhabited, ruined temple suited him, for it is contained 
 a minimum of visible world; the proximity of the workmen also suited him, 
 for they took it upon themselves to provide for his frugal needs. The 
 rice and fruit they brought him were nourishment enough for his body, 
 which was consecrated to the sole task of sleeping and dreaming.
      </p></section>

      <section class="segment"><p>
At first, his dreams were chaotic; then in a short while they became dialectic in nature. 
The stranger dreamed that he was in the center of a circular amphitheater which was more 
or less the burnt temple; clouds of taciturn students filled the tiers of seats; the 
faces of the farthest ones hung at a distance of many centuries and as high as the stars,
but their features were completely precise. The man lectured his pupils on anatomy, cosmography, 
and magic: the faces listened anxiously and tried to answer understandingly, as if they guessed 
the importance of that examination which would redeem one of them from his condition of empty 
illusion and interpolate him into the real world. Asleep or awake, the man thought over the 
answers of his phantoms, did not allow himself to be deceived by imposters, and in certain 
perplexities he sensed a growing intelligence. He was seeking a soul worthy of participating in the universe.
      </p></section>

      <section class="segment"><p>
After nine or ten nights he understood with a certain bitterness that he could expect nothing 
from those pupils who accepted his doctrine passively, but that he could expect something from 
those who occasionally dared to oppose him. The former group, although worthy of love and affection, 
could not ascend to the level of individuals; the latter pre-existed to a slightly greater degree.
 One afternoon (now afternoons were also given over to sleep, now he was only awake for a couple 
 hours at daybreak) he dismissed the vast illusory student body for good and kept only one pupil. 
 He was a taciturn, sallow boy, at times intractable, and whose sharp features resembled of those 
 of his dreamer. The brusque elimination of his fellow students did not disconcert him for long; 
 after a few private lessons, his progress was enough to astound the teacher. 
 Nevertheless, a catastrophe took place. One day, the man emerged from his sleep as if 
 from a viscous desert, looked at the useless afternoon light which he immediately confused with the 
 dawn, and understood that he had not dreamed. All that night and all day long, the intolerable 
 lucidity of insomnia fell upon him. He tried exploring the forest, to lose his strength; among the 
 hemlock he barely succeeded in experiencing several short snatchs of sleep, veined with fleeting, 
 rudimentary visions that were useless. He tried to assemble the student body but scarcely had 
 he articulated a few brief words of exhortation when it became deformed and was then erased. 
 In his almost perpetual vigil, tears of anger burned his old eyes.
      </p></section>

      <section class="segment"><p>
He understood that modeling the incoherent and vertiginous matter of which dreams are composed was the most 
difficult task that a man could undertake, even though he should penetrate all the enigmas of a superior 
and inferior order; much more difficult than weaving a rope out of sand or coining the faceless wind. 
He swore he would forget the enormous hallucination which had thrown him off at first, and he sought 
another method of work. Before putting it into execution, he spent a month recovering his strength, 
which had been squandered by his delirium. He abandoned all premeditation of dreaming and almost 
immediately succeeded in sleeping a reasonable part of each day. The few times that he had dreams 
during this period, he paid no attention to them. Before resuming his task, he waited until the 
moon's disk was perfect. Then, in the afternoon, he purified himself in the waters of the river, 
worshiped the planetary gods, pronounced the prescribed syllables of a mighty name, and went to 
sleep. He dreamed almost immediately, with his heart throbbing.”
      </p></section>

      <section class="segment"><p>
He dreamed that it was warm, secret, about the size of a 
clenched fist, and of a garnet color within the penumbra 
of a human body as yet without face or sex; during fourteen 
lucid nights he dreampt of it with meticulous love. Every 
night he perceived it more clearly. He did not touch it; 
he only permitted himself to witness it, to observe it, 
and occasionally to rectify it with a glance. He perceived 
it and lived it from all angles and distances. On the 
fourteenth night he lightly touched the pulmonary 
artery with his index finger, then the whole heart, 
outside and inside. He was satisfied with the examination. 
He deliberately did not dream for a night; he took up the 
heart again, invoked the name of a planet, and undertook the 
vision of another of the principle organs. Within a year he 
had come to the skeleton and the eyelids. The innumerable hair 
was perhaps the most difficult task. He dreamed an entire man--a 
young man, but who did not sit up or talk, who was unable to open 
his eyes. Night after night, the man dreamt him asleep.

      <section class="segment"><p>
In the Gnostic cosmosgonies, demiurges fashion a red Adam who cannot stand; 
as a clumsy, crude and elemental as this Adam of dust was the Adam of dreams 
forged by the wizard's nights. One afternoon, the man almost destroyed his 
entire work, but then changed his mind. (It would have been better had he 
destroyed it.) When he had exhausted all supplications to the deities of 
earth, he threw himself at the feet of the effigy which was perhaps a tiger 
or perhaps a colt and implored its unknown help. That evening, at twilight, 
he dreamt of the statue. He dreamt it was alive, tremulous: it was not an 
atrocious bastard of a tiger and a colt, but at the same time these two firey 
creatures and also a bull, a rose, and a storm. This multiple god revealed to 
him that his earthly name was Fire, and that in this circular temple (and 
in others like it) people had once made sacrifices to him and worshiped him, 
and that he would magically animate the dreamed phantom, in such a way that 
all creatures, except Fire itself and the dreamer, would believe to be a man 
of flesh and blood. He commanded that once this man had been instructed in 
all the rites, he should be sent to the other ruined temple whose pyramids 
were still standing downstream, so that some voice would glorify him in that 
deserted ediface. In the dream of the man that dreamed, the dreamed one awoke.
      </p></section>

      <section class="segment"><p>
The wizard carried out the orders he had been given. He devoted a 
certain length of time (which finally proved to be two years) to 
instructing him in the mysteries of the universe and the cult of 
fire. Secretly, he was pained at the idea of being seperated from 
him. On the pretext of pedagogical necessity, each day he increased 
the number of hours dedicated to dreaming. He also remade the right 
shoulder, which was somewhat defective. At times, he was disturbed 
by the impression that all this had already happened . . . In general, 
his days were happy; when he closed his eyes, he thought: Now I will 
be with my son. Or, more rarely: The son I have engendered is waiting 
for me and will not exist if I do not go to him.
      </p></section>
      <section class="segment"><p>
Gradually, he began accustoming him to reality. Once he ordered 
him to place a flag on a faraway peak. The next day the flag was fluttering on the peak. He tried other analogous experiments, each time more audacious. With a certain bitterness, he understood that his son was ready to be born--and perhaps impatient. That night he kissed him for the first time and sent him off to the other temple whose remains were turning white downstream, across many miles of inextricable jungle and marshes. Before doing this (and so that his son should never know that he was a phantom, so that he should think himself a man like any other) he destroyed in him all memory of his years of apprenticeship.
</p></section>
 <section class="segment"><p>
His victory and peace became blurred with boredom. 
In the twilight times of dusk and dawn, he would 
prostrate himself before the stone figure, perhaps 
imagining his unreal son carrying out identical 
rites in other circular ruins downstream; at night 
he no longer dreamed, or dreamed as any man does. 
His perceptions of the sounds and forms of the 
universe became somewhat pallid: his absent son was 
being nourished by these diminution of his soul. 
The purpose of his life had been fulfilled; the 
man remained in a kind of ecstasy. After a certain 
time, which some chronicles prefer to compute in 
years and others in decades, two oarsmen awoke him 
at midnight; he could not see their faces, but they 
spoke to him of a charmed man in a temple of the North, 
capable of walking on fire without burning himself. 
The wizard suddenly remembered the words of the god. 
He remembered that of all the creatures that people the earth, 
Fire was the only one who knew his son to be a phantom. 
This memory, which at first calmed him, ended by tormenting him. 
He feared lest his son should meditate on this abnormal privilege 
and by some means find out he was a mere simulacrum. Not to be a 
man, to be a projection of another man's dreams--what an incomparable 
humiliation, what madness! Any father is interested in the sons he 
has procreated (or permitted) out of the mere confusion of happiness; 
it was natural that the wizard should fear for the future of that 
son whom he had thought out entrail by entrail, feature by feature, 
in a thousand and one secret nights.
</p></section>
 <section class="segment"><p>
His misgivings ended abruptly, but not without certain forewarnings. 
First (after a long drought) a remote cloud, as light as a bird, 
appeared on a hill; then, toward the South, the sky took on the 
rose color of leopard's gums; then came clouds of smoke which 
rusted the metal of the nights; afterwards came the panic-stricken 
flight of wild animals. For what had happened many centuries before 
was repeating itself. The ruins of the sanctuary of the god of Fire 
was destroyed by fire. In a dawn without birds, the wizard saw the 
concentric fire licking the walls. For a moment, he thought of taking 
refuge in the water, but then he understood that death was coming to 
crown his old age and absolve him from his labors. He walked toward 
the sheets of flame. They did not bite his flesh, they caressed 
him and flooded him without heat or combustion. With relief, with 
humiliation, with terror, he understood that he also was an illusion, 
that someone else was dreaming him.
